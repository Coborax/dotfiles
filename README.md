# dotfiles

My personal macOS configuration files




## Features
My dotfiles contain configurations for the following
- Nvim (AstroVim) (IDE)
- Alacritty (Terminal Emulator)
- fish (Shell)
- Yabai (Window Manager)
- skhd (Global Shortcuts)
- SketchyBar ()


## Installation

If you want to try out my configurations you can clone this repo, and symlink the configurations you want to try out. (See install.sh for more examples)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coborax/dotfiles
ln -s <PATH_TO_DOTFILES_REPO>/alacritty ~/.config
```
For setting up a new machine with all of my settings run the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coborax/dotfiles
cd dotfiles/
sh install.sh
```
